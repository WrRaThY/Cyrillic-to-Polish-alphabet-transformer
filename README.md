# Cyrillic to Latin (Polish) alphabet transformer
So there are sites that enable you to "transform" (translate seems like a bad word to use) latin (Polish to be exact) characters to Cyrillic alphabet.  
For example this one: 
http://steen.free.fr/cyrpol/index.html

I've tried to find one that does this the other way around and I came out empty-handed.  
So the goal of this project is to provide just that:
### provide a way for people that don't know the Cyrillic alphabet to read text written in it 

The implementation is super-simple, but gets the job done well enough (at least for me ;])

## Running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Deploying
To deploy run:
### `npm run deploy`

This will do everything for you and deploy it to github pages.
